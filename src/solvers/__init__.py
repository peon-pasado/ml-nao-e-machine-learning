"""
This module contains different solvers for the Wave Order Picking problem.
The solvers are organized in the following categories:
- heuristic: Solvers based on heuristics (Simulated Annealing, Greedy)
- exact: Exact solvers based on mixed integer linear programming (OR-Tools)
- hybrid: Solvers that combine different techniques
- decomposition: Solvers based on problem decomposition
